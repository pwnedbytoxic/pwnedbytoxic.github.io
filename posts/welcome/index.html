        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    </header>
    
    <div class="content__body">
        <p>Thank you for stopping by.</p>
<p>This blog exists as a living record of my development as a network engineer. What started as a simple repository for notes and troubleshooting steps has grown into a place where I reflect on lessons learned—both in the lab and in the field—as I pursue professional growth through certifications, hands-on experience, and real-world infrastructure projects.</p>
<h3 id="who-this-site-is-for">Who This Site Is For</h3>
<p>If you’re currently enrolled in a networking class, preparing for certification, or already working in network support or systems administration, this site was built with you in mind. The material I share is meant to strike a balance between foundational concepts and applied skills. Whether it’s interpreting routing table outputs, designing VLAN topologies, building GNS3 simulations, or implementing basic CLI automation with Ansible, I document what I’ve learned in a way that’s intended to be both practical and digestible.</p>
<p>Even if you’re beyond the CCNA level, you may still find value in the way I tie together technical concepts with hands-on deployment—especially in resource-constrained environments like homelabs, public schools, or small businesses.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-can-expect">What You Can Expect</h2>
<p>The posts here follow the arc of my training and work experience. At the moment, that includes:</p>
<p>Notes and insights from working on networking tasks at work and homelabbing</p>
<p>Labs of my own, focusing mostly on network security.</p>
<p>An evolving interest in network programmability, infrastructure as code, and controller-based design</p>
<p>In addition to tutorials and study notes, I occasionally share my thoughts on career development for entry-level techs, certification strategies, and what it means to build resilient, secure infrastructure from the ground up.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-built-this">Why I Built This</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of noise online, and a lot of content that either oversimplifies the work or makes it more intimidating than it needs to be. My goal with this site is to keep things honest, actionable, and grounded in firsthand experience. I’m not an expert, but I am an active practitioner—and this blog is where I document how I’m connecting the dots between education, certification, and applied engineering.</p>
<p>If you’re walking a similar path, I hope this content affirms your progress, sharpens your understanding, or at the very least makes you feel less alone in the process.</p>
<p>Thanks again for visiting. Explore the site, check out my Linkedin if that’s your thing, and feel free to reach out.</p>
<p>— Damon Hoody</p>
