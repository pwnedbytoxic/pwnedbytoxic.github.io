<p>Make sure to read <a href="/posts/ccnafinal">my last post</a> before reading this one. I also recommend reading all of my <a href="/posts/">CCNA chronicles</a>.</p>
<h3 id="may-2025-will-be-a-month-ill-never-forget">May 2025 will be a month I’ll never forget.</h3>
<p>I graduated Summa Cum Laude from both Twinsburg High School and the Cuyahoga Valley Career Center (CVCC), completed the Cisco Networking Academy program, passed the <strong>Cisco CCNA</strong>, and was named the <strong>#1 Student Network Engineer in the Nation</strong> at <strong>Business Professionals of America (BPA) Nationals</strong> in Orlando.</p>
<p>All of this was the culmination of two years of technical rigor, late nights in the lab, and—by God&rsquo;s grace—a persistent drive to master the fundamentals of network engineering.</p>
<h2 id="walking-the-stage">Walking the Stage</h2>
<p>At CVCC, I found my footing, not just in the IOS CLI, but in life. The Cisco Networking Academy wasn’t just about routers and switches; it was about discipline, learning how to think like an engineer, and learning how to <em>solve problems</em>. Graduating as an outstanding student from that program while finishing my high school diploma at Twinsburg marked a serious milestone. It wasn’t always easy balancing the demands of both, and it required me quiting the high school sport I love most (soccer), but I walked away from it with more than just certifications. I walked away changed.</p>
<h2 id="cisco-certified">Cisco Certified.</h2>
<p>On <strong>May 4th</strong>, I passed the <strong>Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)</strong> exam.</p>
<p>In August 2023, I didn&rsquo;t know the difference between a router and firewall. Now I’m a CCNA, Security+, Network+, and A+, I&rsquo;m subnetting in my head, designing VLAN topologies, and building redundant links. I owe a lot to the tools I used—<strong>Boson ExSim</strong>, <strong>Jeremy&rsquo;s IT Lab</strong>, and most importantly, the mentorship and study structure provided by Mr. Moore at Cuyahoga Valley Career Center. He taught me, most importantly, the formula for success: <strong>aditude + aptitude = altitude</strong>.</p>
<p>Every concept clicked best when I tied it to my real-world experiences: fixing dhcp issues in production networks, provisioning subnets across multiple IDFs, running my homelab with real Cisco gear. Passing the CCNA was just as much about mindset as it was about memorizing commands.</p>
<h2 id="business-professionals-of-america-nationals">Business Professionals of America Nationals</h2>
<p>A week after certifying, I flew to <strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>, to compete in the <strong>BPA Nationals</strong> under the event <em>Network Administration Using Cisco</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/bpa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On <strong>May 10th</strong>, I was awarded <strong>First Place in the Nation</strong>.</p>
<p>Representing my school, my community, and my state at the national level was humbling. I walked in with a goal: to show that dedication, training, and God&rsquo;s timing can bring excellence. I walked out with a gold medal, a plaque, unforgettable memories, and the confidence that this is only the beginning.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>As I prepare to begin my B.S. in Network Engineering and Security from WGU, I carry forward not just technical experience, but the proof that preparation, faith, and discipline will take you far.</p>
<p>Thank you ALL for reading and supporting my journey.</p>
<p>Until next time — peace be upon you.</p>
