<h1 id="a-summer-of-connection">A Summer of Connection</h1>
<p>This summer, I had the chance to stand outside <strong>Cisco’s Seattle office</strong>. Networking has been central to my journey: not just in the cisco equipment I&rsquo;ve used to learn the trade, but in the relationships and opportunities that connect me to my purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ohnug-my-first-meeting">(OH)NUG: My First Meeting</h2>
<p>One highlight was attending my very first <strong>Ohio Networking User Group (OHNUG)</strong> meeting (after missing the May session at <a href="/posts/graduation">BPA</a>. It was a stellar experience &ndash; an environment filled with passionate professionals who genuinely care about building strong networks, both technical and personal. I even got to meet like-minded young folks such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dakota-hendricks-41ba0b289/">Dakota Hendricks</a>, who made the evening so much more meaningful. We had the opportunity to bond in our experiences early into our careers over good food and company.</p>
<p>In fact, it went so well I invited my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sem-eyob/">Sem Eyob</a> to his local chapter, (WA)NUG. More on this later ;)</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned-the-laketec-keynote-on-wi-fi-7">What I Learned: The Laketec Keynote on Wi-Fi 7</h3>
<p>A particular highlight from the OHNUG meeting was the keynote from <strong>Laketec</strong> on <strong>Wi-Fi 7</strong> (IEEE 802.11be). They walked us through several cutting-edge features that will shape the near future of wireless networking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>320 MHz Channel Width</strong><br>
Wi-Fi 7 doubles channel width and steps modulation up to <strong>4096-QAM</strong>, delivering massive throughput gains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>6 GHz Spectrum Utilization</strong><br>
Building on Wi-Fi 6E’s expansion, Wi-Fi 7 makes even better use of the 6 GHz band for cleaner, higher-speed channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spectrum Puncturing</strong><br>
Instead of dropping an entire channel when interference is present, Wi-Fi 7 can <em>carve out</em> the bad slice and continue using the rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-Link Operation (MLO)</strong><br>
Devices can now transmit and receive on multiple bands simultaneously (like 5 GHz + 6 GHz), boosting reliability and speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WPA3 &amp; Security Enhancements</strong><br>
WPA3 is the new baseline for 6 GHz, pushing networks toward stronger, more secure deployments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hearing these concepts and watching the demos directly from Laketec made the theory feel real; it was a glimpse of the tools we’ll soon be using in enterprise and campus networks. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about, so feel free to learn from the professionals on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGKFJwlVHHL5QScOYA74UGpQMf46i1Ang">YouTube series</a> goes even deeper if you’re interested.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-journey-to-seattle">My Journey to Seattle</h2>
<p>Later in the summer, I booked a trip to <strong>Seattle, WA</strong>, where I finally met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sem-eyob/">Sem</a> &ndash; someone I had originally connected with on Linkedin &amp; Instagram months back. What started as a professional connection turned into a discussion into our faith, and this sprouted into a true friendship.</p>
<p>Sem not only showed me the city and introduced me to his friends at a music festival, but also shared his love for Christ in a way that continues to inspire awe in me to this day.</p>
<p>Later on, I got to see firsthand how curiosity and good questions can open doors. Sem and some of his friends had the courage to ask thoughtful, pointed questions during the (WA)NUG session, and as a result, they walked away with valuable connections &ndash; including <strong>senior engineers</strong> and even THE <strong><a href="https://networkautomationnerds.com/">Eric Chou</a></strong>, a name well-respected in the network automation community.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s powerful to witness. Networking isn’t just about attending events, it’s about <em>engaging</em> in them. Having the courage to ask questions, showing genuine investment, and being willing to learn can connect you with people far beyond your immediate circle.</p>
<p>Being able to stand in front of Cisco’s sign that night felt like a full-circle moment; a reminder of how far I’ve come, and the doors still waiting to be opened.</p>
<hr>
<p>This summer has reminded me of the importance of investing in my network, nurturing my faith, and pushing forward in my education and career. The experiences I’ve had, both technical and personal, will stay with me. And they’re only the beginning of what’s ahead.</p>
<p>God bless.</p>
