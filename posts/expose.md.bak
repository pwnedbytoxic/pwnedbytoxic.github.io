## Introduction/Overview

- **Challenge Name:** Expose
- **My Rating:** Medium
- **Category:** Linux exploitation
- **/etc/hosts:** expose.thm
- **Author:** [1337rce](https://tryhackme.com/p/1337rce)
- **Description:** Use your red teaming knowledge to pwn a Linux machine.

## Scanning/Recon

As per usual, we start with a broad nmap scan of all ports with `nmap -p- expose.thm`, which returns us something similar to the following:

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
53/tcp   open  domain
1337/tcp open  waste
1883/tcp open  mqtt
```

With these services, we may begin directory fuzzing (i use `gobuster`)

## Enumeration

- **Web Application:** 
  - URL: http://10.10.10.10 (Example)
  - Technologies: Apache, PHP, etc.
- **Vulnerabilities:** 
  - Identify any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

Discuss your findings during the enumeration phase. This may include web application details, detected vulnerabilities, or anything else that stood out. Mention the technologies in use and any clues that might lead to potential exploits.

## Exploitation

- **Exploitation Method:** (e.g., SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution, etc.)
- **Steps Taken:**
  1. Describe the first step of the exploitation process.
  2. Continue with additional steps as necessary.
- **Outcome:** Explain the result of each step and the final outcome.

This section is dedicated to explaining how you exploited the discovered vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the system. Provide a detailed walkthrough of the steps taken during the exploitation process.

## Privilege Escalation

- **Initial User:** (e.g., low-privilege user)
- **Privilege Escalation Method:** (e.g., kernel exploit, sudo rights, etc.)
- **Steps Taken:**
  1. Explain the first step of privilege escalation.
  2. Continue with additional steps as needed.
- **Outcome:** Describe the final privilege escalation and access to the target.

In this section, document the process of escalating privileges to achieve your ultimate goal, whether it's obtaining root access or reaching a high-privilege user. Provide a step-by-step explanation of each action taken.

## Conclusion

- **Flag:** CTF{flag_here} (if applicable)
- **Lessons Learned:** Briefly summarize key takeaways and lessons learned during the challenge.

Conclude your writeup by summarizing the results, presenting any flags obtained, and discussing what you've learned from the challenge. Share insights or techniques that were particularly useful or noteworthy.
