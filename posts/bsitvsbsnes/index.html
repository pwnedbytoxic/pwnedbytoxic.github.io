<p>When I committed to Western Governors University this year, the obvious choice on paper seemed to be the <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/network-engineering-security-bachelors-program.html">B.S. in Network Engineering and Security (BSNES)</a>. After all, I’ve already built my career trajectory around infrastructure and security engineering, getting a decent foundation in each from the cybersecurity side (see my earlier CTFs), and the networking side with my CCNA, GNS3 labbing, &amp; inclusion on network tasks at work. But after reviewing the curricula side-by-side, I made a deliberate decision to enroll in the <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/information-technology-bachelors-program.html">B.S. in Information Technology (BSIT)</a> instead.</p>
<p>Here’s why.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="emphasis-on-foundations-not-pidgeon-holed-into-one-role">Emphasis on foundations, not pidgeon-holed into one role</h3>
<p>The BSNES program is extremely focused &ndash; which is great for a mid-career engineer locking into a role. But I’m early in my journey, and the BSIT’s broader coverage gives me a more complete grasp of the IT ecosystem: scripting, databases, business systems, and even web development. For someone looking to potentially lead projects or transition fluidly between roles in networking, systems, and ops, that range matters to me.</p>
<h3 id="transfer-credit-overlap">Transfer Credit Overlap</h3>
<p>The BSIT better aligned with my existing certifications: A+, Network+, Security+, and CCNA. It gave me a more flexible path to apply those credits toward actual courses. The BSNES includes additional vendor-neutral certifications in network security, and deeply specialized discrete math and cryptography coursework that, while valuable, could slow my pace due to minimal transfer overlap.</p>
<h3 id="flexible-capstone">Flexible Capstone</h3>
<p>BSIT’s final capstone is more open-ended, allowing me to craft a project that highlights my hybrid skill set: network operations, scripting, and security posture management. With the homelab I’ve built (that will hopefully be seeing a new rack server soon!), I want the freedom to design and showcase a system that bridges traditional IT and emerging network engineering standards.</p>
<h3 id="ats-knows-the-acronym"><strong>ATS Knows the Acronym</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s be honest, <code>B.S. in Information Technology</code> is instantly recognizable to HR teams (and ATS). It’s flexible, widely respected, and doesn’t really require an explanation. I plan to specialize through certifications, projects, and experience; not by boxing myself into a degree title that may feel overly specific outside certain spaces.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the BSIT includes <em>Network and Security Foundations</em>, <em>Linux Foundations</em>, <em>Network and Security Applications</em>, and a number of courses where I can build and document technical work. And I’ll still stack additional certifications on top, like the Fortinet NCP, to show depth in network security and firewalls.</p>
<hr>
<p>This comes after a long deliberation with mentors, peers (shoutout to my BSIT study buddy Brennan), other WGU students, and even my own boss at CVCC that&rsquo;s been enabling me to get more into infrastructure.</p>
<p>I’m not stepping away from network security, I’m actually stepping into it through a wider lens. The BSIT gives me room to build, pivot, and lead in an industry where cross-functional competence and multi-vendor understanding is increasingly valuable (keep your eyes peeled for a post on my new ruckus switch stack setup).</p>
<p>If you disagree with my reasoning, or are weighing any WGU programs and have a similar background in networking or security, feel free to reach out through my contact page at <a href="/contact">/contact</a>. I’m happy to share more about the decision-making process.</p>
<p>God bless.</p>
